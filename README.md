Backup website phuongtanit.blogspot.com to HTML static site

link : https://tanhongit.github.io/phuongtanitblogspot

This blog created 4 years ago and is my first blog with the domain https://phuongtanit.blogspot.com/, working with the purpose of sharing documents, courses, software, computer tips. .. But in mid-2018 the blog was hosted and redirected to the domain https://tanhongit.net

Website https://tanhongit.net currently stopped posting since February 2020, but I still maintain its existence on the internet.

And with the blog phuongtanit.blogspot.com too, I still maintain its existence on the internet for the purpose of saving memories.

In March 2020, I removed the redirect for phuongtanit.blogspot.com for it to work again and I have also moved the overall source code on Blogspot to static HTML for backup storage as a souvenir. However, there are still quite a few errors in this static HTML source.

Currently, tanhongit has established a new site at https://tanhongit.com, specializing in sharing programming knowledge and synthesizing some computer tips and technology. Hope you welcome to read. <3
